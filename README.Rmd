#Project Overview
This Project is part of Daniel Leirer's PhD. I work primarily with the Genes and Psychosis data from the IoPPN. The aim is to create a classifer for Psychosis.

**Directory Function:**  
root directory = contains README and Project files for version control.  
P0-PXX = subproject directories  
figs = contains figures for subproject  
output = contains output files from subproject.  
R = Contains Scripts  
data = contains all data (with exception of large data frames. Uploaded on Google Drive.)  
doc = contains paper, labbook and other documentation.  

# Subproject 0: Characterise
**Aim**:  
To make sure data is suitable for future steps, by giving overview of demographics and data available.
Also Cell Mix is performed to make sure everything is okay down the line. Further we regress out Covariates at this step using a linear model. 

**Script_Strategy:**  
  
1. *p0_CellMix_GAP_FEP_data_07_02_2017.Rmd*
+ apply cellmix to identify poetential confounders from cell proportions. 
2. *p0_characterise_GAP_FEP_data_07_02_2017.Rmd*
+ Characterise cohort. Plot demographics, make tables, do stats.
2. *p0_Split_Data_GAP_FEP_data_07_02_2017.Rmd*
+ Define split for all subproject (80-20). make sure to do this using Sex, Age, Ethnicty.



**Output:**  



# Subproject 1: Hypothesis Free
**Aims:**   
Differential Expression adjusting for Ethnciity Age and Gender using Limma.


**Input:**  
LumiBatch object.  


**Script_Strategy:**    
  
1. *p1_1_GAP_Feature_selection_07_02_2017.Rmd*
+ Script that does limma.  
2. *p1_2_GAP_Machine_learning_07_02_2017.Rmd*
+ Script that screens for best model.  
+ Script also plots
3. *p1_3_GAP_Tuning_07_02_2017.Rmd*
+ Script that tunes best 3 models.  
+ Validate in test data.  
4. *p1_4_GAP_Variables_test_07_02_2017.Rmd*  
+ Check classied samples by PANSS, sex, ethnicty, age, tobacco, ICD10, medication.  
4. *p1_5_GAP_Enrichment_test_07_02_2017.Rmd*  
+ Find most important genes.  
+ Check for enrichment in core genes.  


**Output:**

##Genes and Psychosis (GAP)
The Main Dataset is the Genes and Psychosis Data internal to the IoPPN.  
The following files are associated to this Data.  

File: **Full Gene Expression Object**  
*GAP_FEP_Full_Gene_Expression_Data_Linear.RData*  
Description:
This file contains a lumibatch object with all probes deemed expressed. It is from the gene expression pre processing pipeline. Most probes here are defined as not expressed. It is First Episode Gap Samples, processed using background correction, log 2 transformed, robust spline normalisation. The following tech variables have been regressed out using a linear model:  
ConcNanodrop, Dateout, concentrationoflabelledcRNA, DatecRNApurification
